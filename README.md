This is a fastai notebook. I was interested to test out fastai to setup and run an image classificaton deep learning model. This a CNN classifier to identify the exact type of varmint that attacks wook. The code here is mostly adapted from what is publicly provided by fastai (check it out at https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/02_production.ipynb) as of October 2021.
